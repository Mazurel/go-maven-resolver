# Description

This is a tool that takes a name of a Java Maven package or a POM file and returns the URLs of all its dependencies.

I've decided to write this because I could not find a way to achieve the same thing using Gradle or Maven.

For more details see [this Gradle Forum post](https://discuss.gradle.org/t/how-to-get-full-list-of-dependencies-and-their-meta/35825).

Status: __Work in progress__
